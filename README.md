# Vuedraggable_Testing
It's a demo for testing Vuedraggable. unfortunately it's not working in this moment.

I didn't put assertion in testing script, you could add it if you want.

The example is base on [draggable-example](https://github.com/David-Desmaisons/draggable-example) and I removed some code for simplification.

*** I'm using Windows follow command may need to be changed slightly if you are using other OS ***
